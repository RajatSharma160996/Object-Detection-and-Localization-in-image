# Object-Detection-and-Localization-in-image
I along with my group partner have made this project as apart of our course work of subject Computer Vision
We have implemented SSD300 and Faster R-CNN for  object detection and localization over Pascal Visual Object Classes(VOC) 2007 dataset.
Faster R-CNN codes are in .py file formate
SSD300 codes are in .ipynb file formate
